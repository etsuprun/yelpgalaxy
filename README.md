# Yelp Categories and Visualization

The Yelp challenge dataset (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) includes data on Yelp reviews, businesses, checkins, users, and tips. It doesn't, however, provide information on business categories and their relationships.

This project completes the following objectives:

* Proccess the reviews JSON to aggregate star ratings, cool/useful/funny votes, and category associations.
* Visualize categories using the ndtv-d3 framework.

See the visualization and the datatable on www.tsuprun.com
