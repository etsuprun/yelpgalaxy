# Yelp Category Galaxy

This project uses the data from the Yelp challenge (http://www.yelp.com/dataset_challenge) in order to aggregate and visualize information about the categories of businesses on Yelp and their attributes, such as:

* category size
* average review rating
* relationship to other categories
* coolness, funniness, and usefulness of reviews

we first clean and process the data to create a dataframe of business categories and category associations (`process_categories.R`). We then visualize the categories using the ndtv-d3 framework (`visualize_categories.R`).

See the visualization and the datatable on www.tsuprun.com
